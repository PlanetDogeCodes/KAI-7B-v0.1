KAI-7B is a fine-tuned version of Mistral-7b capable of better machine learning and adaptation. 
KAI-7B is a very versatile model, outperforming its closest competetor, Meta-Llama 2 70b, in all benchmarks.

As you can see in the benchmark above, KAI-7B excells in STEM but needs work in the Math and Coding fields.

## Notice
Mistral 7B is a pretrained base model and therefore does not have any moderation mechanisms.
