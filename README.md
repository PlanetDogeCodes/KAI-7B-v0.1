KAI-7B Large Language Model (LLM) is a fine-tuned generative text model based on Mistral 7B. With over 7 billion parameters, KAI-7B outperforms its closest competetor, Meta-Llama 2 70b, in all benchmarks we tested.

As you can see in the benchmark above, KAI-7B excells in STEM but needs work in the Math and Coding fields.

## Notice
KAI-7B is a pretrained base model and therefore does not have any moderation mechanisms.
